# Sales Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze 10,000+ sales transactions to reveal product performance, regional trends, and period-over-period growth for actionable business decisions.

## 🛠 Tools Used
Power BI Desktop (.pbix), Excel (source data), DAX for measures

## 🔧 What I built
- Data cleaning steps to standardize dates, categories, and customer segments in Excel/Python  
- Power BI model with relationships between `Sales`, `Products`, `Customers`, and `Regions` tables  
- DAX measures such as Total Revenue, Gross Profit, Average Order Value, and YoY Growth  
- Interactive visuals: trend lines, bar charts, map visuals for geospatial sales, drill-through pages, and KPI cards

## 📊 Recommended pages in the report
1. Overview & KPIs (Revenue, Orders, AOV)  
2. Product Performance (Top products, margin analysis)  
3. Regional Performance (Map + regional KPIs)  
4. Time-series Analysis (monthly/quarterly trends)  
5. Drill-through pages for transaction-level exploration
